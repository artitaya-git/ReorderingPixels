# Reordering Pixels

This work explores the manipulation of a grid by reordering pixels in a found stock image, 
which I selected as a series of bird's eye view images of anonymous geology such as mountains, 
tropical forests, cityscapes, and industrial areas. Inspired by the pixel-sorting techniques 
of Jeff Thomson and Kim Asendorf.

In addition to these techniques, this piece integrates Perlin noise and interactive elements 
controlled by mouse movement to create a dynamic effect using noise and input. I intended the 
work to transform static images into glitch.
